## Project Submission Policy

  * We don't accept ActiveSupport as a dependency because:
    * monkey-patching is bad m'kay
    * implicit dependencies inside activesupport via requires is also bad
    * it's a huge dependency that is often used without any good reasons (ie "oh I need Hash#symbolize_keys!")
  * A project must be focused on solving just one problem
  * At the same time a project must not be anemic
  * A project must follow [semantic versioning](http://semver.org)

## How to submit your project

Submit a pull request with:

* URL to your project
* Description of what it does if you didn't do it already in the project's README
* Indicate if it's beeing already used in production environments (even if it's below 1.0)

**Note:** Issues should only be used for problems found within the micro.rb project itself.
